# Data Types

### Primitive Data Types
 * undefined
 * null
 * boolean
 * string
 * number
 * symbol (introduced in ES6)


*Arrays* and *Functions* are sub-categories of **Objects**.

** Objects

  * Keys are always strings
  * Each key is unique (can only occur once in the object)
  * Each key is associated with exactly one value. (Note that technically, an array or another object would count as "one value" here, even though they contain other values.)
