# TDD with Mocha & Chai (M1W3)

TDD - Test Driven Development
  * Write the tests first before code
  * Benefits  
    * Define how your code is expected to work
    * Help figure out what the problem is
    * Figure out bugs from the start
    * Documentation
    * Modular
    * Save you time & money (Long-term)  


Manual Testing  
  * console.log()  

Happy Path vs Sad Path (edge cases)
  * Happy Path works properly, expected user behaviour
  * Sad Path: testing for invalid data

  Built-In Methods 
  1. `console.assert(condition, error messagr);` condition is true or false; error message displayed when condition is false
  2. build in assert library in node  

    `const assert = require('assert);`

    `assert.strictEqual(actual, expected);`  

Try & Catch  
```javascript
try { 
  test code 
  assert.strictEqual(actual, expected);
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```
error is an object created by node


Module.exports (needs to be exported and imported)
  * to export a portion of the code for testing 
  * module.exports = sayHi;  -> since the function is being exported no need to include () in the function
  * on the other file 
    const assert = require("assert").strict
  const sayHi = require("./say-hi"); //say-hi is the file name you are importing from
